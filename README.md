# CyberSafe-Space
CyberSafe Space is a secure and user-friendly platform designed to provide a safe online environment for users to connect, share information, and interact without compromising their privacy. This project was developed as part of my final year project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
